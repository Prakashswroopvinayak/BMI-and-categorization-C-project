# BMI-and-categorization-C-project
C programming project to calculate BMI of a list of people from a .DAT file and categorize them (underweight, normal, overweight,obesity). Output table is then saved in .OUT file.

## About the project
This project was the final project of an introductory C programming course in UTM. The time given to complete is about 1 month++. I hardly believe that I completed this on the same day the project was announced by teacher because at that time my programming skill is still not so good.
I hope that this project will help my juniors and other people who need example in reading/scanning and storing data in C programming.

Have a look at how I scanned string (name) and numbers separately. That is the hardest part of this project.

Read the PDF (Question 1) for more information about the project.
